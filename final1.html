        <h2>
            How Web Design has Changed Over the Years?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Before web design was created, websites were most frequently filled with plain text and links, and images and any kind of design were of low quality. However, web design
            is a very important and attention-grabbing feature that is a highly recommended feature in creating websites, in 2021. Back then, CSS was not a common or worldwide 
            method until the early 2000s, because styling and web designing were not as advanced and strong as it is now. In the late 1990s, Flash was a very popular technology for websites,
            and was known for the addition of interactivity or interaction in a website, but nowadays, most websites use JavaScript or PHP to add the interaction between users and 
            websites. Lastly, in the early years and stages of the Internet, computers were almost the only way to access the Internet, and not many people had access to computers,
            so web design or the variety of mobile devices were not taken into consideration. However, today mobile devices are the primary source of using the web, and this has
            caused many changes in web design and web development such as using the responsive web design technique. Now allowing a variety of mobile devices and having access to 
            the same things on the web anywhere.
